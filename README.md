## Abstract:
To enhance threat detection, this project investigates
the application of transfer learning in network se-
curity. Two models were developed as part of the
project to examine how threat detection is impacted
by pre-trained models. Specifically, the project eval-
uated how little data may be required to produce an
effective model that can be applied to new threats.
A dataset of traditional network traffic with numer-
ous attacks was used to train one model, whereas IoT
traffic with a single kind of attack (DoS) was used to
train the other model. To test the impact of these
two models’ capacity to be ”transferred” to forecast
attacks in previously uncovered data, they were ap-
plied to additional datasets. The model trained on
more attacks obtained significantly higher accuracy,
indicating that a substantial amount of training data
is required for successful transfer learning
